# Managing Deploy Keys

## Setup
- brew install jq
- Create a personal API token on Github (https://github.com/settings/tokens/new)
- Set GITHUB_API_TOKEN=[token generated]

## Adding a new key

0. bin/deploy_key_manager -n [name]
0. Capture the private key generated by the script and distribute.  Anyone with this key can use the repository for good or evil :-).

## Removing key

0. bin/deploy_key_manager -n [name] -r
0. The key should be removed.  If an error is received, re-run with -l to list current keys

## Listing keys

0. bin/deploy_key_manager -l 

## Using the Key in a normal git workflow
0. Store your private key in ~/.ssh/gittobi
0. chmod 600 your private key
0. Create a ~/.ssh/config file with the following
```
Host gittobi
  Hostname github.com
  User git
  IdentityFile ~/.ssh/gittobi
```
0. git clone gittobi:gittobi/take-home-global-fc
0. cd take-home-global-fc
0. git checkout -b master_my_awesome_feature 
0. code!
0. git push origin master_my_awesome_feature
